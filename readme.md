# MacFolioShell

Welcome to MacFolioShell, a unique portfolio website designed to mimic the look and feel of a Mac terminal. This site offers an interactive way to explore my work, skills, and contact information through a series of command-line inputs.

## Features

- **Terminal Interface**: Experience a command-line interface that brings the essence of a Mac terminal to the web.
- **Interactive Commands**: Use commands to navigate through the website, discover projects, view social links, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Crafted to provide a seamless experience across various devices.

## Getting Started

To interact with MacFolioShell, simply click on the terminal window and start typing the supported commands. Press `Enter` to execute a command.

### Supported Commands

- `whoami`: Displays information about me and what I do.
- `help`: Lists all the available commands.
- `projects`: Shows the projects I have built with links to GitHub repositories.
- `social -a`: Lists all my social network profiles.
- `contact -a`: Displays my contact information.
- `quote -m`: Shows my favourite quote.
- `clear`: Cleans the terminal for a fresh start.

## How It Works

MacFolioShell utilizes vanilla JavaScript to simulate terminal operations. Commands are processed and executed to present information dynamically within the terminal interface.

### Key Functions

- **Event Listeners**: Captures keyboard inputs and clicks to focus on the input field.
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Based on the command input, the website dynamically generates responses, including links to projects and social profiles.
- **Delay Simulation**: Mimics the processing time of commands to enhance the terminal feel.
